# models-oncology

Curated collection of **oncology** and **cancer biology** simulation models for the **biosim** platform. This repository contains 135 computational models of tumor growth, cancer cell dynamics, oncogene signaling, cell cycle dysregulation, and cancer therapeutics.

## What's Inside

### Models (135 packages)

**Oncology** — tumor growth, cancer signaling, and therapeutic interventions:

**Key Areas:** Tumor growth kinetics, cancer cell cycle models, oncogene/tumor suppressor dynamics (p53, Rb, Myc, Ras), angiogenesis, metastasis, drug resistance mechanisms, chemotherapy and targeted therapy models, and cancer stem cell dynamics.

All models use SBML format with tellurium runtime.

## Prerequisites
```bash
pip install "biosim @ git+https://github.com/BioSimulant/biosim.git@main"
```
