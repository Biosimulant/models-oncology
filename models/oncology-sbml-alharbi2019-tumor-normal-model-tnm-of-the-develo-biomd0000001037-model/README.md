**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000001037)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Sana Abdulkream Alharbi; Azmin Sham Rambely

## Description

This ordinary differential equation model of the interactions between tumor and normal cells is based on the publication:S. A. Alharbi and A. S. Rambely, 'Dynamic Simulation for Analyzing the Effects 


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
