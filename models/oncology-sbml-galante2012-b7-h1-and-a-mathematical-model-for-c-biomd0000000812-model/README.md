# Galante2012 - B7-H1 and a Mathematical Model for Cytotoxic T Cell and Tumor Cell Interaction

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000812)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Amanda Galante; Koji Tamada; Doron Levy

## Description

This is a mathematical model that describes the interactions between cytotoxic T cells and tumor cells as influenced by B7-H1 (PD-L1) activity, with a focus on how B7-H1 affects cancer cells apoptosis


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
