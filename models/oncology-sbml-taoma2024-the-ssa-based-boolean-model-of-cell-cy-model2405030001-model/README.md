# Taoma2024 - The SSA-based Boolean model of cell cycle in budding yeast

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2405030001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Kittisak Taoma (1,2); John J. Tyson (3); Pavel Kraikivski (4); Teeraphan Laomettachit (1,2)

## Description

Our model is considered as a Continuous-Time Stochastic Boolean Model. It is extended from the previous work (PMID: 36434030) in order to explain more mutations that are important in cancer, e.g., end


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
