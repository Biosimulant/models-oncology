# Bouchnita2019 - A multiscale model to design therapeutic strategies that overcome drug resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in multiple myeloma

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL1912170004)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Bouchnita A; Vitaly Volpert; Mark J Koury; Andreas Hellander

## Description

Drug resistance (DR) is a phenomenon characterized by the tolerance of a disease to pharmaceutical treatment. In cancer patients, DR is one of the main challenges that limit the therapeutic potential 


## Usage
