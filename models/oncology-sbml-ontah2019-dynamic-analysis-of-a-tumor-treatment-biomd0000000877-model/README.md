# Ontah2019 - Dynamic analysis of a tumor treatment model using oncolytic virus and chemotherapy with saturated infection rate

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000877)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Ontah, G.M.; Trisilowati; Darti, I.

## Description

This is a mathematical model describing the treatment of tumors using oncolytic virus and chemotherapy. The model is comprised of nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the interactions 


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
