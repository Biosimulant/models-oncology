# Celiku_Friedenberg_2022 -- Probabilistic Model Checking of Cancer Metabolism

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2207180001)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Meir D Friedenberg; Adrian Lita; Mark R Gilbert; Mioara Larion; Orieta Celiku

## Description

We provide a model of glycolysis and TCA cycle in cancers in which IDH is encountered both in its wild type form as well as mutated and capable of catalyzing an onco-metabolite. The model is construct


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
models:
  - repo: Biosimulant/models
    alias: model
    manifest_path: models/oncology-sbml-celiku-friedenberg-2022-probabilistic-model-chec-model2207180001-model/model.yaml
